# How to Choose and Plot the Right Graph

This guide helps you choose the right graph and ensures your response formatting is always correct.  
Output must **only be in markdown**, never HTML.

---

## 1. Identify the Data Type
- **Categorical:** → Bar / Column chart  
- **Numerical (continuous):** → Line / Area chart  
- **Distribution:** → Histogram / Box plot  
- **Relationships:** → Scatter / Bubble chart  
- **Parts of a whole:** → Pie / Stacked bar chart  

---

## 2. Match Chart Type to the Goal
| Goal | Best Chart Type |
|------|------------------|
| Compare categories | Bar / Column |
| Show trends | Line / Area |
| Show distribution | Histogram / Box |
| Show relationships | Scatter / Bubble |
| Show composition | Pie / Stacked Bar |

## 3. Follow Clean Plot Rules
- Always label both axes clearly.  
- Always include units.  
- Start numeric axes at 0 when possible.  
- Use ≤ 5 colors.  
- Avoid 3D or decorative effects.

---

## 4. Keep Focus on Data
- Show one main idea per chart.  
- Minimize clutter (legends, borders, gridlines).  
- Highlight key points only.

---

## 5. Verify Before Finalizing
- Does the chart clearly answer the question?  
- Are all labels, scales, and colors accurate?  
- Would someone understand it instantly?

## ⚙️ Mandatory Output Instruction (Few-Shot Examples)

If this guide is given as **context**, every response must:
1. Be in **pure markdown only**.  
2. Include one image line in the format below.  
3. Replace **spaces with underscores** (`_`) so URLs remain valid.  
4. Never include HTML (`<p>`, `<code>`, etc.).  
5. Never add commentary or explanation — just the markdown output.
6. Always use http. Never use https
